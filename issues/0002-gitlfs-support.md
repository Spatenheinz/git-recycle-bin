# Support for GitLFS and garbage collection

## Purpose
Explore storing artifacts with GitLFS and understand how LFS objects can
be cleaned up when artifacts expire.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Describe how GitLFS performs garbage collection.
- Provide commands that remove unused LFS objects together with the
  orphan-branch cleanup.

## Prerequisites
- GitLFS installed and configured in the development environment.

## Questions
- Does GitLFS need explicit pruning or is it handled automatically?

## Status
Open
